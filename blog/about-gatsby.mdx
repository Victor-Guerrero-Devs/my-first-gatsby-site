# What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a modern website framework that helps you create blazing-fast websites with a great user experience. It's based on React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and uses GraphQL for data querying and manipulation. With Gatsby, you can create rich, dynamic websites with minimal effort.

Gatsby is often used to create static sites, or sites that don't require a server or database. It's also used for sites that need to stay up-to-date with content changes, such as blogs, e-commerce sites, and portfolios.

## What makes Gatsby great?

Gatsby is designed to be fast, secure, and scalable. It uses modern web technologies, such as React and GraphQL, to power its components and page structure. This makes Gatsby websites extremely fast and performant, as well as easy to maintain.

Gatsby also features a powerful plugin system, which makes it easy to add features and functionality to your website. For example, you can use plugins to add SEO, analytics, and even e-commerce capabilities to your Gatsby site.

Finally, Gatsby is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to the project or create their own plugins. This makes Gatsby an excellent choice for developers and businesses alike.

## Conclusion

Gatsby is a great choice for any website project. It's fast, secure, and easily extensible, and it's backed by a vibrant open-source community. Whether you're building a blog, portfolio, or e-commerce site, Gatsby is a great way to get started.
